### Ideas

    - Draggable Card component
        - draggable to a dropzone
        - snaps back to original position if not over a dropzone on release
        - snaps to the dropzone target when released over dropzone

### Components

### Notes

    - Should the "Story" component really be considered a "Routing" component? Need to consider the fact that a bigger component might use a Story for something like showing a number from a series of numbers
    - Shouldn't AnimateRandom use Story component
